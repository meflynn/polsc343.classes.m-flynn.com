- Consumers will shift some of their spending to lower cost items, but the figure shows that the predicted difference will not be all that much.

## Academic Dishonesty and Plagiarism

Things to know:

- Don't do it

- Yes, we can tell

- You will fail the assignment

  - Possible the whole course

    - Maybe suspension, too
    
- See the syllabus for more information

- Also see [K-State's student handbook](https://www.k-state.edu/disclosures/handbooks.html) online





## Academic Dishonesty and Plagiarism

On the use of AI and Chatbots:

- Do not use AI or chatbots to complete assignments

- The use of AI and chatbots constitutes plagiarism and will result in the failure on the assignment

- Other reasons not to use AI and chatbots:

  - They are not accurate

  - They are not reliable
  
  - They are not consistent 
  





## Classroom Conduct

1. Be Kind

2. Please make sure your questions and comments pertain to course materials

3. Be respectful of one another in your discussions

4. Reach out if you need help, and reach out early







# Big Picture Preview





## Myths of US Foreign Policy

1. The "national interest"

2. Politics stops at the water's edge

3. Isolationism vs. internationalism

4. "Grand strategy" 

5. US Foreign Policy less important pre-1945

6. Institutions vying for power
