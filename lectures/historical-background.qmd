## Lecture Overview

1. Early Years (1783-1870)

2. Transitional Period (1870-1945)

3. Hegemonic Period (1945-Present)



## Key Questions

1. What are the broad contours of US foreign policy over time?

2. What have been some of the key political and economic divides in each time period?

3. What elements of US foreign policy are common across time period? What changes substantially?

4. What constitutes an "empire"? 

5. How do we reconcile the process of US expansion with popular rhetoric about democracy and (more recently) human rights?

6. How does popular historical memory of these earlier time periods shape views on policy today?



## Why do we care?

1. Try to obtain a basic level of descriptive accuracy

2. Find out if reality matches our basic assumption

3. Identify, or rule out, potential causal factors




# The Basics {.inverse}



## The Basics

- US is territorially much, much smaller

- US interactions with other nations were limited

- World is a bigger place

- US had no alliances with other states until the 20th century

- Military was very small  

- Low defense expenditures

- US and global trade were very low through 1970s

## The Early Years

- America still relatively weak 

- Small population, no military, not economically developed/diversified

- Still vulnerable to attack and economic exploitation

- Key Conflicts:

  - Managing relations with major powers

  - English and Spanish territories in Canada and Florida

  - Territorial conflicts with Native Americans on frontier 

  - Access to the Mississippi

  - Access to foreign markets and shipping rights

:::{.notes}

- France had ambitions to reconquer parts of North America. But the slave revolt in Haiti during the 1790s and Napoleon's defeat in Europe made this impossible.

- The Louisiana Purchase arises from Napoleon's desire to secure financing for his wars in Europe. The US was able to purchase the territory for \$15 million. This is about \$229 million in today's dollars.

- Livingston is US minister to France. He's charged with negotiating the purchase of New Orleans and West Florida. He ends up negotiating the purchase of the entire Louisiana Territory. Notably he exceeded his authority, and President Jefferson at the time opted to ask forgiveness rather than permission from Congress. 

- The War of 1812 is ultimately a side conflict of the Napoleonic Wars. The US is fighting Britain, but Britain is fighting France. The US is also fighting Native Americans who are fighting the US and Britain.

- Jefferson also dispatches Marines to work with mercenaries and local fighters to fight pirates on the Barbary coast. 

- Ultimately this early time period solidifies the US' status as a regional power and mostly secures its borders, though British forces did invade Washington DC and burn the White House in 1814.

- Monroe Doctrine follows from these conflicts. It's an attempt to keep European powers out of the Western Hemisphere. But the US can't enforce it so it largely relies on Britain.
::: 




## The Early Years

The Nullification Crisis

- Tariffs represent one of the biggest sources of conflict in the early US

- New tariffs passed in 1828 and 1832

- Tariffs affect different segments of the population...differently

- Conflict over tariffs for revenue vs tariffs for protection

- South Carolina state convention adopts Ordinance of Nullification in 1832

- President Jackson threatens to send troops to enforce the tariffs

:::{.notes}
- The split is largely along North/South lines.

- South Carolina believes that the tariffs are unfairly targeting them and that they have the right to nullify federal laws that they believe are unconstitutional (but courts have repeatedly struck down nullification). 

- President Jackson threatens to send troops to enforce the tariffs. Congress passes a compromise tariff in 1833 that lowers rates over time. South Carolina repeals the Ordinance of Nullification but also passes a new ordinance nullifying the Force Act, which allows the president to use force to enforce federal laws.
:::



## The Early Years

### Mexican–American War (Pre-War 1836–1846)

Texas

  - Migration of US citizens, slave owners, and slaves into Texas territory

  - Independent Texas, or annexation?
  
California

  - Valuable ports for commerce with Asia

  - American emigration to California increases over time

  - British and French claims?



## The Early Years

### Mexican–American War (1846–1848)

- US offered Mexico ~$35 million in cash and debt forgiveness ($800 million + in today’s dollars)

- US paid $15 million after war

- Cost of war to US: ~$100 million; 13,000+ dead

- Cost of war to Mexico: ~25,000 dead; large economic losses




## The Early Years

### Civil War

- North-South split very deep (slavery, economics, expansion, trade, etc)

- In reality, these are all very closely connected

- Economic interests of the North and South were fundamentally different




## The Early Years

### Civil War: International Dimension

- European attitudes are mixed (oppose slavery, but want weak America)

- Some British politicians supported the North, but many favored the South in an effort to keep the United States divided

- Weakened United States would pose less of a threat to British hegemony

- Independent Southern states would change dynamics of international trade in Britain’s favor





# Transition {.inverse}



## Transition

- US emerges from Civil War as a major power

- US economy grows rapidly, surpassing Great Britain somewhere in the 1870s

- Policymakers start thinking about the US' role in the broader world

- Attention turns to acquiring overseas territories (i.e. colonies)

- The Spanish American War presents the first opportunities for the US to acquire overseas territories

- Spain loses; US walks away with the Philippines, Guam, Puerto Rico, and Cuba (sort of)



## Transition

Supporters of expansion cite:

- Need for a strong navy
- Economy benefits and secure trade markets
- National pride
- Monroe Doctrine
- Religion

Opponents of expansion cite:

- History
- Washington's Farewell Address
- Costs of empire
- Monroe Doctrine
- Religion

## Rise to Great Power Status

Treaty of Versailles

- Often viewed as unfair/unreasonable

- France aimed to punish Germany

- Severe reparations imposed on Germany

- Industrial resources seized

- US Senate rejects Treaty of Versailles Twice


League of Nations: 

- Viewed as a contrast to previous international orders

- Provides for collective security

- Emphasizes self-determination

- Free trade

:::{.notes}
US and League
- President Wilson (a Democrat) supports a more international role for US

- Many Republicans oppose the League and the treaty as written (The Irreconcilables)

- But some prominent Republicans support it (Henry Stimson)

- Debates over US involvement continue throughout the 1920s

- Senate Republicans repeatedly object to participating in League organizations like the International Court of Justice.
