    "text": "Course Requirements\n\nAttendance: 15%\n\nA major component to being successful in this class is just showing up. Every topic we cover will build upon ideas, lessons, themes, etc., that we covered in previous weeks. To do well you must be present.\nLife also happens, and so students will be given three class periods to miss without penalty. After that, students will be given an attendance grade based on the proportion of classes attended relative to the total number of classes.\n\nCollaborative Discussion: 25%\n\nWhile the course has a heavy lecture component students will also spend time reflecting on class materials and discussing that material with classmates. We will use a combination of open discussion and small group discussions. Students will be required to submit 2 discussion questions to Canvas prior to the class discussion meeting for a given topic. Students will be graded on a combination of the quality of the questions they submit, but also on the quality of their in-class contributions.\n\nExams: 30%\n\nThere will be 3 short exams throughout the semester and they will cover material we have already reviewed through readings, lectures, and discussion. All exams are open book and open note assignments and will be completed through Canvas.\n\nCrisis Simulation: 30%\n\nDuring the final week of the semester students will participate in a crisis simulation. The goal of this simulation is to provide students with an opportunity to apply the knowledge that they have acquired throughout the semester to a simulated crisis requiring the attention of US foreign policymakers.\nPrior to the simulation students will be assigned a particular role for the simulation activity. For example, one student will be the President, another will be the Secretary of State, another will be the Secretary of Defense, etc. Students will be expected to prepare for the simulation by reading background materials and preparing a briefing for the President on their assigned topic. Each student should have a list of questions and proposals for the president to consider.\nStudents will ultimately be evaluated on their contributions during the simulation meetings, as well as on the basis of a reflection paper that will be due at the conclusion of the simulation."

    "text": "Classroom Policies\n\nBe kind. This might seem like an odd thing to list first, but I want to emphasize that this is not a normal class environment—this is still a time of unparalleled stress for many of us. We’re still in the middle of a global pandemic, many of us are still very much worried about our own health and safety, and many of us are very much worried about the health and safety of our coworkers, friends, and families. Let’s try to be cognizant of the fact that many of us (if not all) are going to be struggling at various points, and let’s work together to make this semester as educational and enjoyable as possible.\nBe professional. We’re all here to learn, and many of the issues that we discuss have real-world impacts that affect people we know, or in our broader community. We’re here to work together to develop a better understanding of these issues.\nStudy guides and extra credit. The class is the study guide. I do not offer extra credit.\nGrade Appeals. If you believe that I have given you an incorrect grade on an exam, you may submit a written appeal. All appeals must be in writing (they may not be made in person) and must contain an explanation for why the grade is incorrect. I will also require you to wait 24 hours after receiving a grade to submit a written appeal. Please note that even if your appeal is granted, I reserve the right to regrade the assignment in its entirety, meaning that your grade may go up or down depending on my reevaluation of the assignment.\nThe Syllabus. The syllabus is a living document that can and will be altered throughout the duration of the course based both on need and design. Generally, this may mean readings will be removed or added as needed. All changes will be listed on K-State Online, so make sure to check announcements for any such change. Additionally, I maintain the right to all of my own intellectual property presented in this course, whether it is the course lectures or this syllabus. Materials from this course ought not to be reproduced without my expressed permission.\nClassroom conduct. All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the Student Judicial Conduct Code as outlined in the Student Governing Association By Laws, Article V, Section 3, number 2. Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be asked to leave the class."

    "section": "Course Requirements",
    "text": "Course Requirements\n\nAttendance: 20%\n\nA major component to being successful in this class is just showing up. Every topic we cover will build upon ideas, lessons, themes, etc., that we covered in previous weeks. To do well you must be present.\nLife also happens, and so students will be given three class periods to miss without penalty. After that, students will be given an attendance grade based on the proportion of classes attended relative to the total number of classes.\n\nCollaborative Discussion: 20%\n\nWhile the course has a heavy lecture component students will also spend time reflecting on class materials and discussing that material with classmates. We will use a combination of small group discussions and a Think-Pair-Share format—Students will have an opportunity to reflect on the course material independently, discuss the material with a classmate, and then communicate a summation of that discussion with the rest of the class. Students will then submit the notes from their discussion for review and grading. Accordingly, use the notes to keep track of the content of the discussion, ideas that emerge, and any lingering questions that might arise.\n\nContent Quizzes: 20%\n\nThere will be 6-8 content quizzes throughout the semester and they will cover material we have already reviewed through readings, lectures, and discussion. I will announce these ahead of time. All quizzes are open book and open note assignments and will be completed through Canvas. I will also identify the appropriate readings corresponding to each quiz so you do not have to worry about guessing.\n\nDAG Exercise: 20%\n\nOne thing that separates the social sciences from punditry is the effort to be more precise in our understand of social phenomena. One tool that helps us to both crystallize our own thinking, and to communicate our thinking to others, is the directed acyclic graph (i.e. DAG). More casually, this is known as a causal graph. A DAG is simply a collection of nodes, which represent individual variables, and arrows, which represent causal ties. DAGs can range from relatively simple, to complex in structure, but they can all help us to identify causal relationships and develop model specifications to test those relationships.\nStudents should base their DAG exercise on a reading that we have covered prior to the assignment. Do not base it on future readings that we have not yet covered.\nAll DAG assignments will be completed in class. Students must complete the DAG exercise using pen/pencil and paper. Digital copies will not be accepted.\nThe DAG assignments will become increasingly complex as we move through the course. We will spend the class period before each DAG due date reviewing some of the basic concepts associated with causality and drawing a DAG. We will begin with simplistic models and moving to more complex models. The goal is to help students to develop a better understanding of how to identify causal relationships and how to communicate those relationships to others.\nThe general pattern for the three assignments will be as follows:\n\nDAG Exercise 1\n\n\nIdentify the key variables in the reading\nIdentify the causal relationships between the variables\n\n\nDAG Exercise 2\n\n\nIdentify the key variables in the reading\nIdentify the causal relationships between the variables\nIdentify potential confounding variables\n\n\nDAG Exercise 3\n\n\nIdentify the key variables in the reading\nIdentify the causal relationships between the variables\nIdentify potential confounding variables\nIdentify potential mediating variables\nIdentify potential moderating variables\n\n\nPhoto Journal: 20%\n\nStudents will be required to keep a photo journal You will be required to complete 3 entries over the course of the semester. The goal of this assignment is to help students to develop a fuller appreciation for the ways in which their local community connects to the outside world. Here’s the gist of the assignment:\n\nIdentify something around campus, in town, or in the nearby region that connects to US foreign policy and world politics.\nTake a picture of it!\nWrite journal entry in which you:\n\nShare the picture\nTell us what it is\nTell us where it is\nExplain how it ties into US foreign policy and world politics\nReference class materials to help support the connections and explain why it’s important.\n\n\nBe creative! There’s really no right or wrong here, but it’s on you to clearly explain how the subject of your photo ties into the course’s subject matter.\nWe will allocate one class period per month to completing the photo journal assignments. Students should submit a picture of their photo journal entry and a brief write-up of the entry. The write-up should be no more than 500 words. All write-ups will be completed in class using pen/pencil and paper. Digital copies will not be accepted."

    "text": "Classroom Policies\n\nBe kind. This might seem like an odd thing to list first, but I want to emphasize that this is not a normal class environment—this is still a time of unparalleled stress for many of us. We’re still in the middle of a global pandemic, many of us are still very much worried about our own health and safety, and many of us are very much worried about the health and safety of our coworkers, friends, and families. Let’s try to be cognizant of the fact that many of us (if not all) are going to be struggling at various points, and let’s work together to make this semester as educational and enjoyable as possible.\nBe professional. We’re all here to learn, and many of the issues that we discuss have real-world impacts that affect people we know, or in our broader community. We’re here to work together to develop a better understanding of these issues.\nStudy guides and extra credit. The class is the study guide. I do not offer extra credit.\nGrade Appeals. If you believe that I have given you an incorrect grade on an exam, you may submit a written appeal. All appeals must be in writing (they may not be made in person) and must contain an explanation for why the grade is incorrect. I will also require you to wait 24 hours after receiving a grade to submit a written appeal. Please note that even if your appeal is granted, I reserve the right to regrade the assignment in its entirety, meaning that your grade may go up or down depending on my reevaluation of the assignment.\nThe Syllabus. The syllabus is a living document that can and will be altered throughout the duration of the course based both on need and design. Generally, this may mean readings will be removed or added as needed. All changes will be listed on K-State Online, so make sure to check announcements for any such change. Additionally, I maintain the right to all of my own intellectual property presented in this course, whether it is the course lectures or this syllabus. Materials from this course ought not to be reproduced without my expressed permission.\nClassroom conduct. All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the Student Judicial Conduct Code as outlined in the Student Governing Association By Laws, Article V, Section 3, number 2. Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be asked to leave the class."

We will use a combination of small group discussions and a Think-Pair-Share format—Students will have an opportunity to reflect on the course material independently, discuss the material with a classmate, and then communicate a summation of that discussion with the rest of the class. Students will then submit the notes from their discussion for review and grading. Accordingly, use the notes to keep track of the content of the discussion, ideas that emerge, and any lingering questions that might arise.\n\nContent Quizzes: 20%\n\nThere will be 6-8 content quizzes throughout the semester and they will cover material we have already reviewed through readings, lectures, and discussion. I will announce these ahead of time. All quizzes are open book and open note assignments and will be completed through Canvas. I will also identify the appropriate readings corresponding to each quiz so you do not have to worry about guessing.\n\nPhoto Blog Journal: 20%\n\nStudents will be required to keep a photo blog. You will be required to complete 3 posts over the course of the semester. The goal of this assignment is to help students to develop a fuller appreciation for the ways in which their local community connects to the outside world. Here’s the gist of the assignment:\n\nIdentify something around campus, in town, or in the nearby region that connects to US foreign policy and world politics.\nTake a picture of it!\nWrite blog post of 800-1000 words in which you:\n\nShare the picture\nTell us what it is\nTell us where it is\nExplain how it ties into US foreign policy and world politics\nShare their posts with other students in the class\nThe post must include hyperlink citations or parenthetical references with full citation information where appropriate.\n\n\nRemember, you must complete 3 posts throughout the semester. You must also complete approximately 1 post per month! These assignments require some thought, so plan accordingly. I will not accept late posts.\nBe creative! There’s really no right or wrong here, but it’s on you to clearly explain how the subject of your photo ties into the course’s subject matter.\nTo complete this assignment you will have to create a blogger blog and submit the URL to Canvas. We will make sure this content is sharable through Canvas so students can explore each other’s work. You can watch a tutorial on how to set up your blog here.\n\nThe Music of Foreign Policy Wiki: 30%\n\nThe arts are a powerful tool for communicating ideas across space and time, and are often deeply rooted in the politics of the moment. Over the last century music has increasingly come to serve as a vehicle for political speech, both reflecting and driving politics in the modern era. To that end, students will work together in small groups to build a Wiki-style page presenting a song or album that relates to US foreign policy in some way. The goal of this project is for students and their groups to build a wiki page on Canvas is dedicated to providing readers with a deeper understanding of the historical, political, and social underpinnings of songs. But there’s a catch—since this is a class on US foreign policy, these songs have to be related to US foreign policy in some way.\nIn general, each group’s wiki page should focus on the following points:\n\nSong/Album: Identify a song (or if you’re feeling ambitious, an entire album) that speaks to some aspect of US foreign policy.\nIssue: Identify the central issue, actors, policy, action, idea, behavior, etc., that is at the core of the song.\nContext: Once you have identified the central issue, provide some historical background information. This should help readers to better understand the social, political, and economic issues of the time period in question. Who are the key actors? What are the issues or policies of the time that serve as the focus for the song/album?\nReception: How was the song/album received at the time of its release? Both critically and with respect to the popular impact that it had at the time?\nLegacy: What is the legacy of the song/album? How does its legacy compare with its impact at the time of its release?\n\nThis will serve as your final project. Accordingly, I expect the final content to be detailed, polished, and thoroughly proofed. Your grade will be broken up into components and there will be multiple checkpoints along the way. The schedule is detailed below.\nDeadlines:\n\nSeptember 9: Song/album choices due (2.5%)\nSeptember 23: Final song/album selection due (2.5%)\nOctober 28: Annotated bibliography due (10%)\nNovember 18: Wiki draft due (5%)\nDecember 9: Final Wiki page due (10%)"

    "text": "Classroom Policies\n\nBe kind. This might seem like an odd thing to list first, but I want to emphasize that this is not a normal class environment—this is still a time of unparalleled stress for many of us. We’re still in the middle of a global pandemic, many of us are still very much worried about our own health and safety, and many of us are very much worried about the health and safety of our coworkers, friends, and families. Let’s try to be cognizant of the fact that many of us (if not all) are going to be struggling at various points, and let’s work together to make this semester as educational and enjoyable as possible.\nBe professional. We’re all here to learn, and many of the issues that we discuss have real-world impacts that affect people we know, or in our broader community. We’re here to work together to develop a better understanding of these issues.\nStudy guides and extra credit. The class is the study guide. I do not offer extra credit.\nGrade Appeals. If you believe that I have given you an incorrect grade on an exam, you may submit a written appeal. All appeals must be in writing (they may not be made in person) and must contain an explanation for why the grade is incorrect. I will also require you to wait 24 hours after receiving a grade to submit a written appeal. Please note that even if your appeal is granted, I reserve the right to regrade the assignment in its entirety, meaning that your grade may go up or down depending on my reevaluation of the assignment.\nThe Syllabus. The syllabus is a living document that can and will be altered throughout the duration of the course based both on need and design. Generally, this may mean readings will be removed or added as needed. All changes will be listed on K-State Online, so make sure to check announcements for any such change. Additionally, I maintain the right to all of my own intellectual property presented in this course, whether it is the course lectures or this syllabus. Materials from this course ought not to be reproduced without my expressed permission.\nClassroom conduct. All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the Student Judicial Conduct Code as outlined in the Student Governing Association By Laws, Article V, Section 3, number 2. Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be asked to leave the class."

    "section": "Academic Honesty and Plagiarism",
    "text": "Academic Honesty and Plagiarism\nAll work turned in as a part of this class must be original.\nKansas State University has an Honor & Integrity System based on personal integrity which is presumed to be sufficient assurance in academic matters one’s work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full and part time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning.\nA component vital to the Honor & Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: “On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.”\nThe default in this class is that ALL work will be accomplished individually, UNLESS my permission is given in advance of an assignment/quiz/exam/take-home exam/final. If you are in doubt, please ask.\nA grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.\nFor more information, visit the Honor & Integrity System home web page. All work is expected to adhere to the standards outlined by the Kansas State University Handbook. All written work is subject to online plagiarism checks and will be required for all reaction papers as well as the final paper. Any cases of plagiarism will receive an automatic failure for the assignment, possible failure in the course, and will be pursued further through the university for additional punishment.\nThe Kansas State University Handbook (2008, Appendix F) defines plagiarism as follows:\n\nPlagiarism is taking credit for someone else’s ideas, work, or words. In a university setting, it means submitting academic, scholarly, or literary work in which you either claim or imply the material to be your own, when that is not the case.\n\nThe Handbook also provides examples of plagiarism, and steps students can take to avoid it:\n[P]lagiarism could include:\n\nBuying a term paper, or copying another person’s paper, even if she or he gives you permission.\nCutting and pasting information from the internet into your own paper without properly identifying it as a quotation and properly attributing the source.\nUsing someone else’s concept and presenting it as if it is your own original creativity, without acknowledging the source of the idea.\n\nWhile some acts of plagiarism are obvious attempts to deceive, like buying a term paper, others result from sloppy scholarship or failure to follow proper format for crediting sources. For example:\n\nIf you copy directly from another source and acknowledge it in your bibliography or list of works cited, yet fail to put it in quotation marks, this is plagiarism. The reason is that, although you have indicated that the idea is someone else’s, the lack of quotation marks implies that the words are your own.\nParaphrasing is summarizing a source so that you have rewritten the material in your own words but maintained the original author’s ideas. When you paraphrase, you do not need to put the words in quotation marks, but you do need to properly attribute the original source. Paraphrasing does not mean simply changing one or two words, or leaving out a sentence, while the rest remains the same. Even if you identify the original author, but have used faulty paraphrasing that retains too much of the original, the result is inadvertent plagiarism.\nIf you use another researcher’s specific methodology, you should acknowledge doing so. While some research protocols are widespread and general enough to need no citation, if the protocol, analysis, or technique can be attributed to a specific publication it should be cited.\nWorks of visual art and design, and images of the work, cannot be misrepresented as original work by another. Such images cannot be used in part or whole without permission of the artist.\n\nAlso note that using papers previously written for another assignment in this, or in any other class, without the express permission of the professor is grounds for failing an assignment. Using your own material in this way, and not citing it, is also technically plagiarism and can be treated as such. If you have concerns regarding any of these issues please do not hesitate to contact me."

    "section": "Course Requirements",
    "text": "Course Requirements\n\nAttendance: 10%\n\nA major component to being successful in this class is just showing up. Every topic we cover will build upon ideas, lessons, themes, etc., that we covered in previous weeks. To do well you must be present.\n\nCollaborative Discussion: 20%\n\nWhile the course has a heavy lecture component students will also spend time reflecting on class materials and discussing that material with classmates. We will use a combination of small group discussions and a Think-Pair-Share format—Students will have an opportunity to reflect on the course material independently, discuss the material with a classmate, and then communicate a summation of that discussion with the rest of the class. Students will then submit the notes from their discussion for review and grading. Accordingly, use the notes to keep track of the content of the discussion, ideas that emerge, and any lingering questions that might arise.\n\nContent Quizzes: 20%\n\nThere will be 6-8 content quizzes throughout the semester and they will cover material we have already reviewed through readings, lectures, and discussion. I will announce these ahead of time. All quizzes are open book and open note assignments and will be completed through Canvas. I will also identify the appropriate readings corresponding to each quiz so you do not have to worry about guessing.\n\nDAG Exercise: 20%\n\nOne of the things that separates the social sciences from punditry is the effort to be more precise in our understand of social phenomena. One tool that helps us to both crystallize our own thinking, and to communicate our thinking to others, is the directed acyclic graph (i.e. DAG). More casually, this is known as a causal graph. A DAG is simply a collection of nodes, which represent individual variables, and arrows, which represent causal ties. DAGs can range from relatively simple, to complex in structure, but they can all help us to identify causal relationships and develop model specifications to test those relationships.\nStudents should choose three readings to serve as a basis for their DAG assignment. These readings should also be from separate weeks and NOT from the same week. Rather, don’t wait to the last week of class to cram in three DAG assignments.\nEach DAG assignment will consist of the following parts:\n\nQuestion: After reading one of our in-class reading assignments (article, book, etc.) students will identify a new research question. This should aim to clearly articulate a specific question on which we can structure a research project.\nObjective: What is the objective of the research question? Students should clearly describe the goal and the scope of the proposed question/analysis.\nEstimand: Borrowing from Lundberg, Johnson, and Stewart (2021), the estimand consists of 1) a unit-specific quantity, and 2) a description of the target population. Importantly, you must explain how this estimand relates to your research question. Is it an appropriate measure given your question?\nDAG: Using the Dagitty web platform draw the DAG outlining the relationships between the outcome of interest, key predictor variable, and other relevant variables (e.g. confounders).\nNarrative: This is where you explain how the variables are related to one another. The DAG is useful insofar as it tells us which variables are related, but it doesn’t make clear how one affects another. This is where theory becomes important.\nThe Music of Foreign Policy Wiki: 30%\n\nThe arts are a powerful tool for communicating ideas across space and time, and are often deeply rooted in the politics of the moment. Over the last century music has increasingly come to serve as a vehicle for political speech, both reflecting and driving politics in the modern era. To that end, students will work together in small groups to build a Wiki-style page presenting a song or album that relates to US foreign policy in some way. The goal of this project is for students and their groups to build a wiki page on Canvas is dedicated to providing readers with a deeper understanding of the historical, political, and social underpinnings of songs. But there’s a catch—since this is a class on US foreign policy, these songs have to be related to US foreign policy in some way.\nIn general, each group’s wiki page should focus on the following points:\n\nSong/Album: Identify a song (or if you’re feeling ambitious, an entire album) that speaks to some aspect of US foreign policy.\nIssue: Identify the central issue, actors, policy, action, idea, behavior, etc., that is at the core of the song.\nContext: Once you have identified the central issue, provide some historical background information. This should help readers to better understand the social, political, and economic issues of the time period in question. Who are the key actors? What are the issues or policies of the time that serve as the focus for the song/album?\nReception: How was the song/album received at the time of its release? Both critically and with respect to the popular impact that it had at the time?\nLegacy: What is the legacy of the song/album? How does its legacy compare with its impact at the time of its release?\n\nThis will serve as your final project. Accordingly, I expect the final content to be detailed, polished, and thoroughly proofed. Your grade will be broken up into components and there will be multiple checkpoints along the way. The schedule is detailed below.\nDeadlines:\n\nSeptember 9: Song/album choices due (2.5%)\nSeptember 23: Final song/album selection due (2.5%)\nOctober 28: Annotated bibliography due (10%)\nNovember 18: Wiki draft due (5%)\nDecember 9: Final Wiki page due (10%)\n\nEach iteration of this assignment should be drafted on Microsoft Word or Apple Pages, and submitted to Canvas."

This might seem like an odd thing to list first, but I want to emphasize that this is not a normal class environment—this is still a time of unparalleled stress for many of us. We’re still in the middle of a global pandemic, many of us are still very much worried about our own health and safety, and many of us are very much worried about the health and safety of our coworkers, friends, and families. Let’s try to be cognizant of the fact that many of us (if not all) are going to be struggling at various points, and let’s work together to make this semester as educational and enjoyable as possible.\nBe professional. We’re all here to learn, and many of the issues that we discuss have real-world impacts that affect people we know, or in our broader community. We’re here to work together to develop a better understanding of these issues.\nStudy guides and extra credit. The class is the study guide. I do not offer extra credit.\nGrade Appeals. If you believe that I have given you an incorrect grade on an exam, you may submit a written appeal. All appeals must be in writing (they may not be made in person) and must contain an explanation for why the grade is incorrect. I will also require you to wait 24 hours after receiving a grade to submit a written appeal. Please note that even if your appeal is granted, I reserve the right to regrade the assignment in its entirety, meaning that your grade may go up or down depending on my reevaluation of the assignment.\nThe Syllabus. The syllabus is a living document that can and will be altered throughout the duration of the course based both on need and design. Generally, this may mean readings will be removed or added as needed. All changes will be listed on K-State Online, so make sure to check announcements for any such change. Additionally, I maintain the right to all of my own intellectual property presented in this course, whether it is the course lectures or this syllabus. Materials from this course ought not to be reproduced without my expressed permission.\nClassroom conduct. All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the Student Judicial Conduct Code as outlined in the Student Governing Association By Laws, Article V, Section 3, number 2. Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be asked to leave the class."

For example:\n\nIf you copy directly from another source and acknowledge it in your bibliography or list of works cited, yet fail to put it in quotation marks, this is plagiarism. The reason is that, although you have indicated that the idea is someone else’s, the lack of quotation marks implies that the words are your own.\nParaphrasing is summarizing a source so that you have rewritten the material in your own words but maintained the original author’s ideas. When you paraphrase, you do not need to put the words in quotation marks, but you do need to properly attribute the original source. Paraphrasing does not mean simply changing one or two words, or leaving out a sentence, while the rest remains the same. Even if you identify the original author, but have used faulty paraphrasing that retains too much of the original, the result is inadvertent plagiarism.\nIf you use another researcher’s specific methodology, you should acknowledge doing so. While some research protocols are widespread and general enough to need no citation, if the protocol, analysis, or technique can be attributed to a specific publication it should be cited.\nWorks of visual art and design, and images of the work, cannot be misrepresented as original work by another. Such images cannot be used in part or whole without permission of the artist.\n\nAlso note that using papers previously written for another assignment in this, or in any other class, without the express permission of the professor is grounds for failing an assignment. Using your own material in this way, and not citing it, is also technically plagiarism and can be treated as such.

    "text": "Artificial Intelligence\nArtificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models (LLMs), and chatbots have seen increased use recently. While these resources can be useful tools in certain contexts, their use is prohibited in this course and any such use will be treated as plagiarism and/or unauthorized outside assistance (you shouldn’t need them anyway). There are multiple reasons for this. The purpose of taking this course is to learn new material and develop a deeper comprehension of that material to help you make sense of the world around you. This requires you engage directly with the coursework. Second, while these tools can be useful for certain tasks, using them intelligently and effectively often requires you have a strong knowledge of the underlying content. Absent that knowledge you are ill-equipped to judge the usefulness of what these resources generate.\nThis course assumes that all your course work will be done by you. You will not need to use artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT for any of the assignments. In general, for this class, you should not have an AI instrument do the writing of any portion of any assignment, just as you would not have another person do your writing for you. My aim is to keep the focus on your originality and creativity, your learning and reflection. Using an AI tool to generate assignment content would be a violation of the K-State Honor Pledge."
