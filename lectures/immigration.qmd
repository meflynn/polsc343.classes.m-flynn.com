## What Drives Immigration?

Lots of things, but for now we'll focus on a basic IPE approach to political economy

- Push Factors
    - Lack of economic opportunity (i.e. jobs)
    - War and conflict
    - Repression and violence
    - Crime
    
- Pull Factors
    - Basically the same, but the inverse
    - Attracted to job opportunities
    - Less crime/violence
    - More political participation

## What Drives Immigration?


Heckscher--Ohlin Framework

- Think of migration in terms of trade theory
- Countries *export* goods that make intensive use of the factors that are abundant
- Countries *import* goods that make intensive use of the factors that are scarce

Migration as factor mobility

-  Just as investors move capital around seeking a greater return on investment, so too do individuals move trying to find greater returns on **their** investment (i.e. time, effort, skills, etc.)
