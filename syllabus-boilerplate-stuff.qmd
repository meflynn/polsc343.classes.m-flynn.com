## Academic Honesty and Plagiarism
  
All work turned in as a part of this class must be original.

Kansas State University has an Honor & Integrity System based on personal integrity which is presumed to be sufficient assurance in academic matters one’s work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full and part time
students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance
learning.

A component vital to the Honor & Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all
assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied,
whether or not it is stated: “On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid
on this academic work.”

The default in this class is that ALL work will be accomplished individually, UNLESS my permission is given
in advance of an assignment/quiz/exam/take-home exam/final. If you are in doubt, please ask.

A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X
indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.

For more information, visit the [Honor & Integrity System home web page](http://www.k-state.edu/honor/).
All work is expected to adhere to the standards outlined by the Kansas State University Handbook. All
written work is subject to online plagiarism checks and will be required for all reaction papers as well as the
final paper. Any cases of plagiarism will receive an automatic failure for the assignment, possible failure in
the course, and will be pursued further through the university for additional punishment.

The Kansas State University Handbook (2008, Appendix F) defines plagiarism as follows:

> Plagiarism is taking credit for someone else’s ideas, work, or words. In a university setting, it
means submitting academic, scholarly, or literary work in which you either claim or imply the
material to be your own, when that is not the case.

The Handbook also provides examples of plagiarism, and steps students can take to avoid it:

[P]lagiarism could include:

  - Buying a term paper, or copying another person’s paper, even if she or he gives you permission.
  - Cutting and pasting information from the internet into your own paper without properly
identifying it as a quotation and properly attributing the source.
  - Using someone else’s concept and presenting it as if it is your own original creativity, without
acknowledging the source of the idea.

While some acts of plagiarism are obvious attempts to deceive, like buying a term paper, others
result from sloppy scholarship or failure to follow proper format for crediting sources. For
example:

  - If you copy directly from another source and acknowledge it in your bibliography or list of
works cited, yet fail to put it in quotation marks, this is plagiarism. The reason is that,
although you have indicated that the idea is someone else’s, the lack of quotation marks
implies that the words are your own.
  - Paraphrasing is summarizing a source so that you have rewritten the material in your own
words but maintained the original author’s ideas. When you paraphrase, you do not need to
put the words in quotation marks, but you do need to properly attribute the original source.
Paraphrasing does not mean simply changing one or two words, or leaving out a sentence,
while the rest remains the same. Even if you identify the original author, but have used faulty
paraphrasing that retains too much of the original, the result is inadvertent plagiarism.
  - If you use another researcher’s specific methodology, you should acknowledge doing so.
While some research protocols are widespread and general enough to need no citation, if
the protocol, analysis, or technique can be attributed to a specific publication it should be
cited.
  - Works of visual art and design, and images of the work, cannot be misrepresented as
original work by another. Such images cannot be used in part or whole without permission
of the artist.

Also note that using papers previously written for another assignment in this, or in any other class, without
the express permission of the professor is grounds for failing an assignment. Using your own material in
this way, and not citing it, is also technically plagiarism and can be treated as such. If you have concerns
regarding any of these issues please do not hesitate to contact me.


## Statement on Mutual Respect and Inclusion in K-State Teaching and Learning Spaces

At K-State, faculty and staff are committed to creating and maintaining an inclusive and supportive learning environment for students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives.

If you feel uncomfortable because of comments or behavior encountered in this class, you may bring it to the attention of your instructor, advisors, and/or mentors. If you have questions about how to proceed with a confidential process to resolve concerns, please contact the Student Ombudsperson Office.

## Statement Regarding Discrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Harassment

Kansas State University is committed to maintaining academic, housing, and work environments that are free of discrimination, harassment, and sexual harassment. Instructors support the University’s commitment by creating a safe learning environment during this course, free of conduct that would interfere with your academic opportunities. Instructors also have a duty to report any behavior they become aware of that potentially violates the University’s policy prohibiting discrimination, harassment, and sexual harassment (PPM 3010).  

If a student is subjected to discrimination, harassment, or sexual harassment, they are encouraged to make a non-confidential report to the University’s Office for Institutional Equity (OIE) using the online reporting form. Incident disclosure is not required to receive resources at K-State. Reports that include domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, should be considered for reporting by the complainant to the Kansas State University Police Department or the Riley County Police Department. Reports made to law enforcement are separate from reports made to OIE. A complainant can choose to report to one or both entities. Confidential support and advocacy can be found with the K-State Center for Advocacy, Response, and Education (CARE). Confidential mental health services can be found with Lafene Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS). Academic support can be found with the Office of Student Life (OSL). OSL is a non-confidential resource. A comprehensive list of resources is available here. If you have questions about non-confidential and confidential resources, please contact OIE at [equity@ksu.edu](mailto:equity@ksu.edu) or (785) 532–6220.
