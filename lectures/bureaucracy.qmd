## Lecture Overview

1. Historical Trends

2. What are bureaucracies?

3. Why do they matter?

4. The State Department





## Key Questions

1. How did the foreign policy buraucracy change between the pre- and post-War periods?

2. Why/How might suboptimal policy outcomes result from otherwise good actors following organizational mandates?

3. How are actors at different positiosn in a bureaucratic hierarchy able to exercise power and influence?

4. How has the State Department's role in foreign policymaking changed over time?






# What Are Bureaucracies?




## What Are Bureaucracies?


Executive bureaucracy before World War II

- Very small

- Creation of the Executive Office of the President (EOP) in 1939 

- Foreign policy activism spurs demand for personnel, expertise

- Senior administrators up through World War II generall had little government experience

- Bureaucracy didn't become a "career" until post-1940s

# Why Do Bureaucracies Matter?



## Why Do Bureaucracies Matter?

They're responsible for a lot...

- Presidents make thousands of appointments after entering office

- Hundreds of these relate to foreign policymaking

- Direct presidential involvement varies

  - Personal taste

  - Big three: State, Defense, Treasury
  
  - Subordinates?

## The State Department

SEC. 101. [22 U.S.C. 2151] GENERAL POLICY.—(a):

> The Congress finds that fundamental political, economic, and technological
changes have resulted in the interdependence of nations. The Congress declares that the individual liberties, economic prosperity, and security of the people of the United States are best sustained and enhanced in a community of nations which respect individual civil and economic rights and freedoms and which work together to use wisely the world’s limited resources in an open and equitable international economic system. Furthermore, the Congress reaffirms the traditional humanitarian ideals of the American people and renews its commitment to assist people in developing countries to eliminate hunger, poverty, illness, and ignorance.

> Therefore, the Congress declares that a principal objective of the foreign policy of the United States is the encouragement and sustained support of the people of developing countries in their ef-
forts to acquire the knowledge and resources essential to development and to build the economic, political, and social institutions which will improve the quality of their lives.
