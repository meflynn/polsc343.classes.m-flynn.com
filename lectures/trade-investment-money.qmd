## Key Questions

1. How has the importance of trade to the US economy changed over time?

2. What is protectionism? What role has it played in the history of US development?

3. What is the difference between fiscal and monetary policy? How do they relate to one another?

4. How does an industry's size relate to its ability to get protectionist policies?

5. What are the positions of the two major parties been on trade policy? How have they changed over time?

6. What are some of the major changes in immigration policy across US history?

7. How has immigration been a tool of US foreign policy?








## Key concepts and terms

### Trade

Trade: The flow of goods and services between countries

Imports: Goods and services that are consumed within a referent country but produced in another.

Exports: Goods and services that are produced within a referent country for consumption in another.

Aggregation: We can talk about how to group different businesses or products (specific items, technologies, industries, sectors, etc.)

:::{.notes}

Notes

Example of aggregation: North American Industry Classification System Item ##311111: Dog and cat food (e.g., canned, dry, frozen, semi-moist), manufacturing.

Another: 311330 Cocoa, powdered, mixed with other ingredients, made from purchased chocolate

:::





## Terminology Key concepts and terms

### Finance and Monetary Policy

Finance: Refers to the flow of capital (cash) within and across borders
  
  - Portfolio Investment
  - Sovereign Lending
  - Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)

Monetary Policy: Refers to the supply and valuation of currency

  - Interest rates
  - Money supply









# Historical Background







## Historical Background

Trade before 1934

- Protectionism is dominant approach to US economic development

- Northeastern manufacturing interests had substantial political influence and favor protectionist policies

- Southern and Western agricultural interests less influential and favor freer trade polices. 






## Historical Background

Trade after 1934

- Northeastern and Southern interests align in 1930s and 1940s

- Both groups come to support freer trade

- Protectionist barriers begin to come down

- World War II marks an important turning point

![Percentage of members of the House and Senate voting in support of freer trade over time. Taken from Hiscox 1999.](../images/hiscox-1999-figure.png){width=650px height=760px fig-align=center}






## Historical Background

### Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act (RTAA) of 1934

- Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) granted to executive to negotiate trade agreements

- Origin of "fast track" authority

- Grants president authority to negotiate reductions in tariffs with other countries

- Establishes objectives and places scope parameters on those negotiations

- Extended 11 times through 1962

:::{.notes}
Notes

- Trade Promotion Authority is a general term describing the delegation of powers to the executive to negotiate trade agreements.

- Part of the rationale is to limit Congressional meddling in negotiated agreements so other countries are more likely to engage. If they suspect Congress will alter an agreement then they might not trust the US delegation.

- Initially limited President's TPA to three years.

- Initially limited agreements themselves to three-year time windows unless renewed.

- See [Brookings article](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/fast-track-trade-promotion-authority/) on fast track authority.

:::









## Historical Background

### Trade Act of 1974

- Further extends fast track authority

- Reaffirms Executive power to reduce tariffs without further action

- Establishes parameters on Executive negotiations, reporting, and consultation with Congress

- Promises an amendment-free vote to reassure negotiators and trading partners

- Guarantees vote within fixed period of time


:::{.notes}

Notes

- Partly a response to the increasing use of non-tariffs barriers to trade, like health and safety regulations

- Congress doesn't want executive effectively crafting law over non-tariff regulations

- President can negotiate agreements that require changes to US law, but Congress must act and approve those changes.

- Bill must be automatically discharged out of the relevant committee after 45 days if it has not been reported

- Chamber must vote within 15 days of a bill being discharged from committee

:::



## Historical Background

### Bretton Woods System

- Partly a reaction to pre-World War II move to autarky

- Three main components

  - General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
  - International Monetary Fund (IMF)
  - International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank)
  
:::{.notes}

Notes

- GATT focuses on promoting free trade and lowering tariff barriers
- IMF focuses on short-term imbalances in payments between states
- World Bank promotes development in less developed countries

# Why Does Trade Matter?







## Why Does Trade Matter?

Theoretical

- Realism/Mercantilism

  - Trade as a source of national power
  
  - Trade is a zero-sum game
  
- Liberal theory

  - Trade can be positive-sum (both/multiple players can "win")
  
  - Trade has other beneficial effects (e.g. it promotes peaceful relations between states)
  
:::{.notes}

Notes

- Historically nations very wary of trade as it might enrich adversaries
- Adam Smith and David Ricardo came along and talked about the benefits of specialization and free markets.
- We see greater moves towards free trade throughout the 1800s, mostly as a response to British leadership and technological change
- Ideas gain steam in 20th century through Woodrow Wilson's 14 Points

:::




  


## Why Does Trade Matter?

Tangible benefits

- Trade creates jobs

- Access to desirable goods (spices, cool cars, technology, media/entertainment)

Less tangible

- Soft power and prestige

- Information, education, etc.










# Trade as a Policy Instrument










## Trade as a Policy Instrument

Trade can be a source of power---States can use it to get what they want

But how?

- Revenue generation

- Control over vital resources

- Market access (think bargaining)





## Trade as a Policy Instrument

Revenue generation

- Trade represents the flow of goods and services across borders

- These transactions can be taxed!

- Revenues can be used for various projects

:::{.notes}

Notes

- Note that other factors can affect commodity prices, including supply chain disruptions, weather events, changes in consumer demand, etc.

- Coffee demand has increased sharply over the last few years in other parts of the world, in addition to the US.

- Major exporters include Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Uganda, India, Honduras, and Mexico.

- Brazil (37%), Vietnam (17%), and Colombia (8%) alone account for 60% of global coffee production.

- Droughts, fires, and other weather events have affected production in some of these countries recently. This has driven prices up as well, and commodity price increases have started to break through to producers and consumers more than they usually do. Adding tariffs on top of this only exacerbates the problem.

- See USDA page on [coffee production](https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/production/commodity/0711100)

## Trade as a Policy Instrument

Control over vital resources

- What types of resources?

  - Energy (oil, gas, coal, etc.)
  
  - Food (grains, meat, etc.)
  
  - Strategic minerals (rare earths, metals, etc.)

- Necessary for survival of the state, everyday life, etc.
  
- Few substitutes, few alternative suppliers

- Labor or capital intensive production processes

:::{.notes}
Notes

- Sometimes things like rare earth minerals are rare because they are difficult to mine or process, not because they are actually rare in nature.

Notes

- US has close relations with Saudi government, 1930s through present.
- US companies win concessions to look for oil in 1938. Saudi government wary of European countries with colonial pasts. Favor US.
- Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco) finds Saudi oil reserves in 1944. Saudi government steadily buys out foreign interests through 1980.
- US wary of broader Middle East region and energy reserves. Objects to USSR trying to establish foothold in region after WWII.

Notes

- Mountain Pass Mine has been in operation for over 70 years

- It is the only operating rare earth mining and processing facility in the US. It accounts for over 10% of the world's supply of rare earth minerals. See [their webpage](https://mpmaterials.com/materials/) for details.

- Rare earth minerals are used in a variety of high-tech applications, including electronics, renewable energy technologies, and military hardware

- Specific rare earths include 

  - Neodymium-praseodymium Oxide is used to make magnets that are used in motors, generators, and more
  
  - Neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) metal is used to make magnets
  
  - Lanthanum carbonate is used in batteries and in the production of jet fuel

## Trade as a Policy Instrument

Market access and bargaining

- Producers need markets. Scaling up production requires larger markets.

- Exports bring in money from the sale of goods

- Domestic consumer base is often limited in various ways (money, taste, interests, etc.)

- Provides bargaining power

## Trade as a Policy Instrument

:::{.incremental}
Does this mean trade is hurting your economy?

No!

Let's look at how GDP is calculated:

$$GDP_{it} = Consumption_{it} + Investment_{it} + Government_{it} + (Exports_{it} - Imports_{it})$$
  
:::










## Trade as a Policy Instrument

Protectionism and market access

- Trade creates winners and losers

- Some countries can produce goods more/less efficiently than others

- Domestic producers who are relatively inefficient tend to favor protectionism (i.e. government intervention)












## Trade as a Policy Instrument

Forms of Protectionism

- Trade protection can come in a variety of policy interventions

  - Tariffs: Taxes on imported goods
  
  - Quotas: Limits on how much of a good is imported
  
  - Subsidies: Government payments to purchase goods or offset costs of donig business
  
  - Health and safety regulations: Creating different standards between importers and exporters

What is the benefit to foreign countries?

:::{.incremental}
- Dominican Republic share = 189,343 metric tons

- World raw sugar price (2025) $\approx$ 16.39 cents/lb.

- US raw sugar price (2025) $\approx$ 36.87 cents/lb.

- Difference = 20.48 cents/lb.

- So what?

- That's about $85.5 million more than world market—Nearly 0.7% of the Dominican Republic's GDP in 2023!

- Some industries are politically powerful for reasons apart from economic salience

- Manufacturing sector has a lot of influence

- Heavily tied into American image of production and the importance of making things

  - Protect domestic industries
  
  - Leverage bargaining power in trade negotiations

# Monetary Policy





## Monetary Policy

People need money to buy things

- Theoretically, we could use all sorts of stuff!

- A commonly held/used/accepted currency (e.g. "brand") of money helps resolve coordination problems

- US dollar is widely used and valued, making it a great basis for global commercial exchange

:::{.notes}
Notes

- Money is a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account.

- One problem the constitution was designed to solve was the lack of federal control over money. Colonies/states used to print their own, with wildly different valuations and management regimes. 

:::







## Monetary Policy

A couple of approaches to establishing currency and valuation

- Commodity money

  - Currency backed by a physical good (e.g. gold, silver, etc.)
  
  - Historically common, but has limitations (scarcity, divisibility, transportability, etc.)
  
- Fiat money

  - Currency backed by government decree
  
  - Value comes from trust in government and its management of the currency




## Monetary Policy

So how do governments manage their money?

For present purposes, let's focus on two key topics

- Money supply

- Interest rates


:::{.notes}
Notes

- The "supply" of money can be a tricky concept. It can be used to refer to the total amount of money that exists, but also the amount that's in circulation and available for spending.

:::{.notes}
Notes

- M2 money consists of cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money, like money market funds and savings deposits. 

- It doesn't include things like retirement savings.

- Designed to capture the amount of money that is readily available for spending.

## Monetary Policy

  - Setting interest rates
  
  - Buying and selling assets

- The federal funds rate affects the overnight lending rate between banks, which in turn affects other interest rates throughout the economy.

- Banks borrow from each other to meet reserve requirements set by the Federal Reserve.

## Monetary Policy

Bonds---How do *they* work?

- Bonds are loans made to the government with the promise of repayment

- Bonds have... 
  - a face or par value (e.g. $1,000), 
  - a coupon rate (e.g. 5%), 
  - and a maturity date (e.g. 10 years)
  
- You initially buy a bond for more or less than its face value. 
  
- You might buy a savings bond and hold it until maturity, at which point you collect the face value plus interest

- Some bonds have fixed interest rates (e.g. 2.5% for 30 years) based on the face value

- A bond's yield is a function of its price and coupon rate

:::{.notes}
Notes

- Bonds have a face value and a purchase value.
- Series EE bonds are purchased at half their face value and mature to full face value over 20 years. They can be worth more if held for the full 30 years.
- Bonds are debt securities issued by governments or corporations to raise capital.
- The yield of a bond is the effective return on investment, which can change based on the bond's price in the market.
- If a bond is in demand then the price goes up and the yield goes down. 
- Note that the coupon rate remains fixed, but the yield changes as the price changes.
- For example, if you buy a bond with a face value of \$1,000 and a coupon rate of 5% then your annual payment will be \$50. 
- That \$50 yield changes as the price of the bond changes.

- Ultimately you care about 1) What you paid for the bond, and 2) What you get back from the bond in the payments. This is how you assess the value of a bond relative to other investments.
:::





## Monetary Policy

Yield Curve

- The yield curve shows interest rates across different bond maturities

- Normally longer maturities (e.g. 30 year bonds) have higher yields than shorter-term maturities (e.g. 2 year bonds)

- When short-term rates are higher than long-term rates, the yield curve is inverted

- An inverted yield curve is often a predictor of recession


:::{.notes}
Notes

- The yield curve is a graphical representation of interest rates across different maturities.
- Normally, longer-term bonds have higher yields to compensate for the increased risk of holding them over a longer period.
- An inverted yield curve, where short-term rates exceed long-term rates, can signal economic uncertainty and is often seen as a predictor of recession.

- Yield changes because investors are moving money between long and short-term bonds based on their expectations of future interest rates and economic conditions.

- The yield curve inverts when investors are wary of near-term conditions, so they move money out of short-term bonds and into longer-term bonds. This drives up the price of long-term bonds and pushes down their yields.

## Monetary Policy 

Open Market Operations (OMO)

- Central Bank can buy securities, like bonds

- Purchases occur on private markets, not directly from the Treasury

- Buying up bonds increases liquidity, and pushes interest rates down

- Selling bonds reduces liquidity, and pushes interest rates up

- Quantitative Easing (QE) is similar

:::{.notes}

How do bonds work?

- Bond (loan) has face value, say 100.
- You can pay 50 for that with the promise of getting 100 back at maturity
- You can also buy/sell that bond for more/less than what you paid.
- You buy a bond for 50, but sell it for 75
- Yield (interest rate) goes down because the price went up
- Rising prices can be because:
  - Debt is less attractive
  - New debt has higher interest rate

:::


## Monetary Policy 

Effects of lowering interest rates

- Lower rates makes money cheaper and more abundant

- Businesses and people will consume more

- Increased demand and consumption will drive prices up and unemployment down

## Monetary Policy

Liquidity Swaps

- The Federal Reserve works with foreign banks to ensure global liquidity

- During times of crisis, foreign banks may have trouble getting access to dollars

- Fed can set up swap lines to provide dollars to foreign banks

- This involves two transactions:

  - First: Bank of England agrees to sell British Pounds to Fed for US dollars
  
  - Second: Bank of England agrees to repurchase its Pounds from the Fed at a later date for US dollars plus interest

:::{.notes}
Notes

- Foreign governments maintain bank accounts at the NY Federal Reserve

- Whenever they need dollars, they can sell their currency and then the Fed credits their account at the NY Federal Reserve Bank, from which they can draw funds. 

- US makes profit off of the interest charged on these swaps.
