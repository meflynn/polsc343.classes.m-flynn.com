It will provide a brief background\non the history of US foreign policy before 1900, but will focus primarily on the developments and issues\noccurring from 1900 through the present. The historical content of the course will be supplemented by\nintroducing students to political science literature that can help to identify and explain key events and trends\nin US foreign policy during this time period. \n\n## Course Objectives\n\n1. The overarching goal is to develop an understanding\nof the systematic forces that shape US foreign policymaking. Please note that this is different than\nprescribing what policy *should* be (though this is also an important consideration when considering our motivations for studying the topic and reading course materials.\n2. Identify the key actors that influence foreign policy.\n3. Understand how and when the influence of actors varies (e.g. across time, issue area, etc.).\n4. Identify the key issues confronting policymakers and society. \n5. Identify general trends in US foreign policy over time. \n    - What's changed? \n    - What stays the same?\n    - When and why do we see changes in behavior or policies?\n6. Students should develop a familiarity with social science research processes, practices. Specifically, students should have:\n    - A basic understanding of how to read social scientific research articles. \n    - A basic understanding of research design considerations\n    - A basic understanding of what the scope and limitations of research articles\n\n\n## Course Format \n\nThe course will be part lecture and part student participation. I encourage students to ask questions if the readings of lecture materials are unclear. In addition to class lectures students will be responsible for keeping up with readings and other class-related material as the semester progresses.\n\n\n### Modality Changes\n\nSo what happens if we have to revert back to remote learning because of COVID? Ultimately my goal is to structure the course in a way to preserve our flexibility to the fullest extent possible. I have pre-recorded lectures available on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7AzCLAufJAMCKkDL77clzw). In the event that we need to move to online only learning students can still view the lectures corresponding to each of the topics we're going to cover this semester. We will also use Zoom where needed to facilitate continued discussion. \n\n## Required Books \n\nThere are three required books and several required articles (listed below in the course schedule).  You can view the full citation in the reference list at the end of hover your cursor over the citation below for a preview of the full title.\n\n- @Karlin2022\n- @GeorgeRishikof2017\n- @Norris2021\n\n\n## Additional Readings\n\nStudents should also make an effort to stay informed on current events. Below are a some examples of good sources for keeping up with global events. Please note that some of these publications may be pay-walled, but you should have access through the university library.\n\n  - [BBC News](www.bbc.com/news)\n  - [The Monkey Cage](www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkeycage)\n  - [Political Violence @ a Glance](www.politicalviolenceataglance.org)\n  - [Foreign Affairs](www.foreignaffairs.com)\n  - [Foreign Policy Magazine](www.foreignpolicy.com)\n  - [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/us)\n  - [The Washington Post](www.washingtonpost.com)\n  - [The New York Times](www.nytimes.com)\n  - [The Economist](www.economist.com)\n  - [The Financial Times](www.ft.com)\n  \n\n## Course Requirements\n\n1. _Collaborative Discussion: 30%_\n\nWhile the course has a heavy lecture component students will also spend time reflecting on class materials and discussing that material with classmates. We will use a combination of small group discussions and a Think-Pair-Share format---Students will have an opportunity to reflect on the course material independently, discuss the material with a classmate, and then communicate a summation of that discussion with the rest of the class. Students will then submit the notes from their discussion for review and grading. Accordingly, use the notes to keep track of the content of the discussion, ideas that emerge, and any lingering questions that might arise.\n\n\n2. _Content Quizzes: 20%_\n\nThere will be 6-8 content quizzes throughout the semester and they will cover material we have already reviewed through readings, lectures, and discussion. I will announce these ahead of time. All quizzes are open book and open note assignments and will be completed through Canvas. I will also identify the appropriate readings corresponding to each quiz so you do not have to worry about guessing. \n\n\n3. _Photo Blog Journal: 20%_\n\nStudents will be required to keep a photo blog. You will be required to complete **3 posts** over the course of the semester. The goal of this assignment is to help students to develop a fuller appreciation for the ways in which their local community connects to the outside world. Here's the gist of the assignment:\n\n  - Identify something around campus, in town, or in the nearby region that connects to US foreign policy and world politics. \n  - Take a picture of it!\n  - Write blog post of 800-1000 words in which you:\n    - Share the picture\n    - Tell us what it is\n    - Tell us where it is\n    - Explain how it ties into US foreign policy and world politics\n    - Share their posts with other students in the class\n    - The post must include hyperlink citations or parenthetical references with full citation information where appropriate.\n    \nRemember, you must complete **3 posts** throughout the semester. You must also complete approximately **1 post per month!** These assignments require some thought, so plan accordingly. I will not accept late posts.\n    \nBe creative! There's really no right or wrong here, but it's on you to clearly explain how the subject of your photo ties into the course's subject matter. \n  \nTo complete this assignment you will have to create a blogger blog and submit the URL to Canvas. We will make sure this content is sharable through Canvas so students can explore each other's work. You can [watch a tutorial on how to set up your blog here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVy0_BcV7nU).\n  \n4. _The Music of Foreign Policy Wiki: 30%_\n\nThe arts are a powerful tool for communicating ideas across space and time, and are often deeply rooted in the politics of the moment. Over the last century music has increasingly come to serve as a vehicle for political speech, both reflecting and driving politics in the modern era. To that end, students will work together in small groups to build a Wiki-style page presenting a song or album that relates to US foreign policy in some way. The goal of this project is for students and their groups to build a wiki page on Canvas is dedicated to providing readers with a deeper understanding of the historical, political, and social underpinnings of songs. But there's a catch—since this is a class on US foreign policy, these songs have to be related to US foreign policy in some way. \n\nIn general, each group's wiki page should focus on the following points:\n\n  - *Song/Album*: Identify a song (or if you're feeling ambitious, an entire album) that speaks to some aspect of US foreign policy.\n  - *Issue*: Identify the central issue, actors, policy, action, idea, behavior, etc., that is at the core of the song. \n  - *Context*: Once you have identified the central issue, provide some historical background information. This should help readers to better understand the social, political, and economic issues of the time period in question. Who are the key actors? What are the issues or policies of the time that serve as the focus for the song/album? \n  - *Reception*: How was the song/album received at the time of its release? Both critically and with respect to the popular impact that it had at the time?\n  - *Legacy*: What is the legacy of the song/album? How does its legacy compare with its impact at the time of its release?\n\n\nThis will serve as your final project. Accordingly, I expect the final content to be detailed, polished, and thoroughly proofed. Your grade will be broken up into components and there will be multiple checkpoints along the way. The schedule is detailed below.\n\nDeadlines: \n\n- September 9: Song/album choices due (2.5%)\n- September 23: Final song/album selection due (2.5%)\n- October 28: Annotated bibliography due (10%)\n- November 18: Wiki draft due  (5%)\n- December 9: Final Wiki page due (10%)\n  \n  \n  \n## Classroom Policies\n\n1. Be kind. This might seem like an odd thing to list first, but I want to emphasize that this is not a normal class environment---this is still a time of unparalleled stress for many of us. We're still in the middle of a global pandemic, many of us are still very much worried about our own health and safety, and many of us are very much worried about the health and safety of our coworkers, friends, and families. Let's try to be cognizant of the fact that many of us (if not all) are going to be struggling at various points, and let's work together to make this semester as educational and enjoyable as possible. \n\n2. Be professional. We're all here to learn, and many of the issues that we discuss have real-world impacts that affect people we know, or in our broader community. We're here to work together to develop a better understanding of these issues. \n\n3. Study guides and extra credit. The class is the study guide. I do not offer extra credit.\n\n4. Grade Appeals. If you believe that I have given you an incorrect grade on an exam, you may submit\na written appeal. All appeals must be in writing (they may not be made in person) and must contain\nan explanation for why the grade is incorrect. I will also require you to wait 24 hours after receiving a\ngrade to submit a written appeal. Please note that even if your appeal is granted, I reserve the right\nto regrade the assignment in its entirety, meaning that your grade may go up or down depending on\nmy reevaluation of the assignment.\n\n5. The Syllabus. The syllabus is a living document that can and will be altered throughout the duration\nof the course based both on need and design. Generally, this may mean readings will be removed or\nadded as needed. All changes will be listed on K-State Online, so make sure to check announcements\nfor any such change. Additionally, I maintain the right to all of my own intellectual property presented\nin this course, whether it is the course lectures or this syllabus. Materials from this course ought not\nto be reproduced without my expressed permission.\n\n6. Classroom conduct. All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by\nthe Student Judicial Conduct Code as outlined in the Student Governing Association By Laws, Article\nV, Section 3, number 2. Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may\nbe asked to leave the class.\n  \n  \n## Academic Honesty and Plagiarism\n  \nAll work turned in as a part of this class must be original.\n\nKansas State University has an Honor & Integrity System based on personal integrity which is presumed to be sufficient assurance in academic matters one’s work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full and part time\nstudents enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance\nlearning.\n\nA component vital to the Honor & Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all\nassignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied,\nwhether or not it is stated: “On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid\non this academic work.”\n\nThe default in this class is that ALL work will be accomplished individually, UNLESS my permission is given\nin advance of an assignment/quiz/exam/take-home exam/final. If you are in doubt, please ask.\n\nA grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X\nindicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.\n\nFor more information, visit the [Honor & Integrity System home web page](http://www.k-state.edu/honor/).\nAll work is expected to adhere to the standards outlined by the Kansas State University Handbook. All\nwritten work is subject to online plagiarism checks and will be required for all reaction papers as well as the\nfinal paper. Any cases of plagiarism will receive an automatic failure for the assignment, possible failure in\nthe course, and will be pursued further through the university for additional punishment.\n\nThe Kansas State University Handbook (2008, Appendix F) defines plagiarism as follows:\n\n> Plagiarism is taking credit for someone else’s ideas, work, or words. In a university setting, it\nmeans submitting academic, scholarly, or literary work in which you either claim or imply the\nmaterial to be your own, when that is not the case.\n\nThe Handbook also provides examples of plagiarism, and steps students can take to avoid it:\n\n[P]lagiarism could include:\n\n  - Buying a term paper, or copying another person’s paper, even if she or he gives you permission.\n  - Cutting and pasting information from the internet into your own paper without properly\nidentifying it as a quotation and properly attributing the source.\n  - Using someone else’s concept and presenting it as if it is your own original creativity, without\nacknowledging the source of the idea.\n\nWhile some acts of plagiarism are obvious attempts to deceive, like buying a term paper, others\nresult from sloppy scholarship or failure to follow proper format for crediting sources. For\nexample:\n\n  - If you copy directly from another source and acknowledge it in your bibliography or list of\nworks cited, yet fail to put it in quotation marks, this is plagiarism. The reason is that,\nalthough you have indicated that the idea is someone else’s, the lack of quotation marks\nimplies that the words are your own.\n  - Paraphrasing is summarizing a source so that you have rewritten the material in your own\nwords but maintained the original author’s ideas. When you paraphrase, you do not need to\nput the words in quotation marks, but you do need to properly attribute the original source.\nParaphrasing does not mean simply changing one or two words, or leaving out a sentence,\nwhile the rest remains the same. Even if you identify the original author, but have used faulty\nparaphrasing that retains too much of the original, the result is inadvertent plagiarism.\n  - If you use another researcher’s specific methodology, you should acknowledge doing so.\nWhile some research protocols are widespread and general enough to need no citation, if\nthe protocol, analysis, or technique can be attributed to a specific publication it should be\ncited.\n  - Works of visual art and design, and images of the work, cannot be misrepresented as\noriginal work by another. Such images cannot be used in part or whole without permission\nof the artist.\n\nAlso note that using papers previously written for another assignment in this, or in any other class, without\nthe express permission of the professor is grounds for failing an assignment. Using your own material in\nthis way, and not citing it, is also technically plagiarism and can be treated as such. If you have concerns\nregarding any of these issues please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\n\n## Statement on Mutual Respect and Inclusion in K-State Teaching and Learning Spaces\n\nAt K-State, faculty and staff are committed to creating and maintaining an inclusive and supportive learning environment for students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives.
