## Lecture Overview

1. Defining multilateralism

2. Historical review of multilateralism in US foreign policy

3. Costs and benefits

4. Why Multilateralism?






## Key Questions

1. What are the costs and benefits of cooperation?

2. When are countries more or less likely to cooperate?

3. How has the emphasis on multilateralism changed throughout US history?


:::{.notes}
## Opening Exercise

1. Take a moment to write down a list of some of the major foreign policy issues that the US faces.

2. Which of these policy areas requires multilateral cooperation? In which policy areas can the US effectively pursue unilateral action?

# Defining Multilateralism






## Defining Multilateralism



> **Multilateralism** refers to efforts to coordinate behavior between three or more actors.





# Historical Overview








## Historical Overview

Multilateralism in US foreign policy

- For the most part, US foreign policy is mostly characterized by unilateralism through World War I

- World War I marks a slight turn towards multilateralism, but there's a lot of resistance

- After World War II multilateralism becomes a central component of US foreign policy







## Historical Overview

Multilateralism in security, diplomatic, and economic affairs

- North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)

- United Nations (UN)

- General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)

- International Monetary Fund (IMF)

- World Bank






# Costs and Benefits






## Costs and Benefits

Multilateralism has a range of shorter-term benefits

- Pooling resources

- Distribute costs

- Enhanced legitimacy

But there are also costs

- Decreased autonomy/constraints on behavior

- Possible costs via side payments 

- More diffuse policy benefits

## Costs and Benefits

But even short-term tradeoffs can have long-term benefits

The US was the dominant military and economic power following the War, but how best to wield that power?

- A retreat from engagement to unilateralism like after World War I?
  
- Assert dominant power to control other countries?
  
- Something else?

>**Liberal Hegemony**: A term coined by John Ikenberry to describe the nature of the international order that obtained following World War II where the US acted as the dominant power presiding over a rules-based international system to which it subordinated itself (at least in part).





# Costs and Benefits

Multilateralism was part of a strategy to balance and advance multiple objectives

- Secure Western allies

- Deter Soviet aggression

- Perpetuate the United States' dominant position for the long-term

Liberal Hegemony entailed a few key components

- US sacrificed some autonomy, binding itself to a set of rules-based arrangements in different policy areas

- By binding itself the US obtained the buy-in from other countries, increasing the legitimacy and long-term viability of US-led projects




# Why Multilateralism?





## Why Multilateralism?


Lots of different and important issues, but what do they have in common?

:::{.incremental}

- Well, there's a shared, fundamental problem underlying these issues

- Collective action and coordination problems
:::




## Basic problems

>**Collective Action Problems:** Interactions where individuals/groups would all benefit from cooperating to produce some good, but where individual players have an incentive to defect.


>**Coordination Problems**: Coordination therefore, is the orderly arrangement of group effort, to provide unity of action in the pursuit of a common purpose. (Mooney 1947)

> ALSO

> [A] coordination problem exists if achievement of a particular organizational goal requires that each actor select the appropriate action, and the goal is not fully achieved if all members of the group do not select goal-fulfilling actions. (Camerer and Knez 1997)
