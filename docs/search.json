    "section": "Course Requirements",
    "text": "Course Requirements\n\nAttendance: 10%\n\nA major component to being successful in this class is just showing up. Every topic we cover will build upon ideas, lessons, themes, etc., that we covered in previous weeks. To do well you must be present.\n\nCollaborative Discussion: 20%\n\nWhile the course has a heavy lecture component students will also spend time reflecting on class materials and discussing that material with classmates. We will use a combination of small group discussions and a Think-Pair-Share format—Students will have an opportunity to reflect on the course material independently, discuss the material with a classmate, and then communicate a summation of that discussion with the rest of the class. Students will then submit the notes from their discussion for review and grading. Accordingly, use the notes to keep track of the content of the discussion, ideas that emerge, and any lingering questions that might arise.\n\nContent Quizzes: 20%\n\nThere will be 6-8 content quizzes throughout the semester and they will cover material we have already reviewed through readings, lectures, and discussion. I will announce these ahead of time. All quizzes are open book and open note assignments and will be completed through Canvas. I will also identify the appropriate readings corresponding to each quiz so you do not have to worry about guessing.\n\nDAG Exercise: 20%\n\nOne of the things that separates the social sciences from punditry is the effort to be more precise in our understand of social phenomena. One tool that helps us to both crystalize our own thinking, and to communicate our thinking to others, is the directed acyclic graph (i.e. DAG). More casually, this is known as a causal graph. A DAG is simply a collection of nodes, which represent individual variables, and arrows, which represent causal ties. DAGs can range from relatively simple, to complex in structure, but they can all help us to identify causal relationships and develop model specifications to test those relationships.\nStudents should choose three readings to serve as a basis for their DAG assignment. These readings should also be from separate weeks and NOT from the same week. Rather, don’t wait to the last week of class to cram in three DAG assignments.\nEach DAG assignment will consist of the following parts:\n\nQuestion: After reading one of our in-class reading assignments (article, book, etc.) students will identify a new research question.\nObjective: What is the objective of the research question? Students should clearly describe the goal and the scope of the proposed question/analysis.\nEstimand: Borrowing from Lundberg, Johnson, and Stewart (2021), the estimand consists of 1) a unit-specific quantity, and 2) a description of the target population. Importantly, you must explain how this estimand relates to your research question. Is it an appropriate measure given your question?\nDAG: Using the Dagitty web platform draw the DAG outlining the relationships between the outcome of interest, key predictor variable, and other relevant variables (e.g. confounders).\nThe Music of Foreign Policy Wiki: 30%\n\nThe arts are a powerful tool for communicating ideas across space and time, and are often deeply rooted in the politics of the moment. Over the last century music has increasingly come to serve as a vehicle for political speech, both reflecting and driving politics in the modern era. To that end, students will work together in small groups to build a Wiki-style page presenting a song or album that relates to US foreign policy in some way. The goal of this project is for students and their groups to build a wiki page on Canvas is dedicated to providing readers with a deeper understanding of the historical, political, and social underpinnings of songs. But there’s a catch—since this is a class on US foreign policy, these songs have to be related to US foreign policy in some way.\nIn general, each group’s wiki page should focus on the following points:\n\nSong/Album: Identify a song (or if you’re feeling ambitious, an entire album) that speaks to some aspect of US foreign policy.\nIssue: Identify the central issue, actors, policy, action, idea, behavior, etc., that is at the core of the song.\nContext: Once you have identified the central issue, provide some historical background information. This should help readers to better understand the social, political, and economic issues of the time period in question. Who are the key actors? What are the issues or policies of the time that serve as the focus for the song/album?\nReception: How was the song/album received at the time of its release? Both critically and with respect to the popular impact that it had at the time?\nLegacy: What is the legacy of the song/album? How does its legacy compare with its impact at the time of its release?\n\nThis will serve as your final project. Accordingly, I expect the final content to be detailed, polished, and thoroughly proofed. Your grade will be broken up into components and there will be multiple checkpoints along the way. The schedule is detailed below.\nDeadlines:\n\nSeptember 9: Song/album choices due (2.5%)\nSeptember 23: Final song/album selection due (2.5%)\nOctober 28: Annotated bibliography due (10%)\nNovember 18: Wiki draft due (5%)\nDecember 9: Final Wiki page due (10%)\n\nEach iteration of this assignment should be drafted on Microsoft Word or Apple Pages, and submitted to Canvas."

This might seem like an odd thing to list first, but I want to emphasize that this is not a normal class environment—this is still a time of unparalleled stress for many of us. We’re still in the middle of a global pandemic, many of us are still very much worried about our own health and safety, and many of us are very much worried about the health and safety of our coworkers, friends, and families. Let’s try to be cognizant of the fact that many of us (if not all) are going to be struggling at various points, and let’s work together to make this semester as educational and enjoyable as possible.\nBe professional. We’re all here to learn, and many of the issues that we discuss have real-world impacts that affect people we know, or in our broader community. We’re here to work together to develop a better understanding of these issues.\nStudy guides and extra credit. The class is the study guide. I do not offer extra credit.\nGrade Appeals. If you believe that I have given you an incorrect grade on an exam, you may submit a written appeal. All appeals must be in writing (they may not be made in person) and must contain an explanation for why the grade is incorrect. I will also require you to wait 24 hours after receiving a grade to submit a written appeal. Please note that even if your appeal is granted, I reserve the right to regrade the assignment in its entirety, meaning that your grade may go up or down depending on my reevaluation of the assignment.\nThe Syllabus. The syllabus is a living document that can and will be altered throughout the duration of the course based both on need and design. Generally, this may mean readings will be removed or added as needed. All changes will be listed on K-State Online, so make sure to check announcements for any such change. Additionally, I maintain the right to all of my own intellectual property presented in this course, whether it is the course lectures or this syllabus. Materials from this course ought not to be reproduced without my expressed permission.\nClassroom conduct. All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the Student Judicial Conduct Code as outlined in the Student Governing Association By Laws, Article V, Section 3, number 2. Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be asked to leave the class."

    "text": "Course Requirements\n\nCollaborative Discussion: 30%\n\nWhile the course has a heavy lecture component students will also spend time reflecting on class materials and discussing that material with classmates. We will use a combination of small group discussions and a Think-Pair-Share format—Students will have an opportunity to reflect on the course material independently, discuss the material with a classmate, and then communicate a summation of that discussion with the rest of the class. Students will then submit the notes from their discussion for review and grading. Accordingly, use the notes to keep track of the content of the discussion, ideas that emerge, and any lingering questions that might arise.\n\nContent Quizzes: 20%\n\nThere will be 6-8 content quizzes throughout the semester and they will cover material we have already reviewed through readings, lectures, and discussion. I will announce these ahead of time. All quizzes are open book and open note assignments and will be completed through Canvas. I will also identify the appropriate readings corresponding to each quiz so you do not have to worry about guessing.\n\nPhoto Blog Journal: 20%\n\nStudents will be required to keep a photo blog. You will be required to complete 3 posts over the course of the semester. The goal of this assignment is to help students to develop a fuller appreciation for the ways in which their local community connects to the outside world. Here’s the gist of the assignment:\n\nIdentify something around campus, in town, or in the nearby region that connects to US foreign policy and world politics.\nTake a picture of it!\nWrite blog post of 800-1000 words in which you:\n\nShare the picture\nTell us what it is\nTell us where it is\nExplain how it ties into US foreign policy and world politics\nShare their posts with other students in the class\nThe post must include hyperlink citations or parenthetical references with full citation information where appropriate.\n\n\nRemember, you must complete 3 posts throughout the semester. You must also complete approximately 1 post per month! These assignments require some thought, so plan accordingly. I will not accept late posts.\nBe creative! There’s really no right or wrong here, but it’s on you to clearly explain how the subject of your photo ties into the course’s subject matter.\nTo complete this assignment you will have to create a blogger blog and submit the URL to Canvas. We will make sure this content is sharable through Canvas so students can explore each other’s work. You can watch a tutorial on how to set up your blog here.\n\nThe Music of Foreign Policy Wiki: 30%\n\nThe arts are a powerful tool for communicating ideas across space and time, and are often deeply rooted in the politics of the moment. Over the last century music has increasingly come to serve as a vehicle for political speech, both reflecting and driving politics in the modern era. To that end, students will work together in small groups to build a Wiki-style page presenting a song or album that relates to US foreign policy in some way. The goal of this project is for students and their groups to build a wiki page on Canvas is dedicated to providing readers with a deeper understanding of the historical, political, and social underpinnings of songs. But there’s a catch—since this is a class on US foreign policy, these songs have to be related to US foreign policy in some way.\nIn general, each group’s wiki page should focus on the following points:\n\nSong/Album: Identify a song (or if you’re feeling ambitious, an entire album) that speaks to some aspect of US foreign policy.\nIssue: Identify the central issue, actors, policy, action, idea, behavior, etc., that is at the core of the song.\nContext: Once you have identified the central issue, provide some historical background information. This should help readers to better understand the social, political, and economic issues of the time period in question. Who are the key actors? What are the issues or policies of the time that serve as the focus for the song/album?\nReception: How was the song/album received at the time of its release? Both critically and with respect to the popular impact that it had at the time?\nLegacy: What is the legacy of the song/album? How does its legacy compare with its impact at the time of its release?\n\nThis will serve as your final project. Accordingly, I expect the final content to be detailed, polished, and thoroughly proofed. Your grade will be broken up into components and there will be multiple checkpoints along the way. The schedule is detailed below.\nDeadlines:\n\nSeptember 9: Song/album choices due (2.5%)\nSeptember 23: Final song/album selection due (2.5%)\nOctober 28: Annotated bibliography due (10%)\nNovember 18: Wiki draft due (5%)\nDecember 9: Final Wiki page due (10%)"

This might seem like an odd thing to list first, but I want to emphasize that this is not a normal class environment—this is still a time of unparalleled stress for many of us. We’re still in the middle of a global pandemic, many of us are still very much worried about our own health and safety, and many of us are very much worried about the health and safety of our coworkers, friends, and families. Let’s try to be cognizant of the fact that many of us (if not all) are going to be struggling at various points, and let’s work together to make this semester as educational and enjoyable as possible.\nBe professional. We’re all here to learn, and many of the issues that we discuss have real-world impacts that affect people we know, or in our broader community. We’re here to work together to develop a better understanding of these issues.\nStudy guides and extra credit. The class is the study guide. I do not offer extra credit.\nGrade Appeals. If you believe that I have given you an incorrect grade on an exam, you may submit a written appeal. All appeals must be in writing (they may not be made in person) and must contain an explanation for why the grade is incorrect. I will also require you to wait 24 hours after receiving a grade to submit a written appeal. Please note that even if your appeal is granted, I reserve the right to regrade the assignment in its entirety, meaning that your grade may go up or down depending on my reevaluation of the assignment.\nThe Syllabus. The syllabus is a living document that can and will be altered throughout the duration of the course based both on need and design. Generally, this may mean readings will be removed or added as needed. All changes will be listed on K-State Online, so make sure to check announcements for any such change. Additionally, I maintain the right to all of my own intellectual property presented in this course, whether it is the course lectures or this syllabus. Materials from this course ought not to be reproduced without my expressed permission.\nClassroom conduct. All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the Student Judicial Conduct Code as outlined in the Student Governing Association By Laws, Article V, Section 3, number 2. Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be asked to leave the class."

    "section": "Academic Honesty and Plagiarism",
    "text": "Academic Honesty and Plagiarism\nAll work turned in as a part of this class must be original.\nKansas State University has an Honor & Integrity System based on personal integrity which is presumed to be sufficient assurance in academic matters one’s work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full and part time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning.\nA component vital to the Honor & Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: “On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.”\nThe default in this class is that ALL work will be accomplished individually, UNLESS my permission is given in advance of an assignment/quiz/exam/take-home exam/final. If you are in doubt, please ask.\nA grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.\nFor more information, visit the Honor & Integrity System home web page. All work is expected to adhere to the standards outlined by the Kansas State University Handbook. All written work is subject to online plagiarism checks and will be required for all reaction papers as well as the final paper. Any cases of plagiarism will receive an automatic failure for the assignment, possible failure in the course, and will be pursued further through the university for additional punishment.\nThe Kansas State University Handbook (2008, Appendix F) defines plagiarism as follows:\n\nPlagiarism is taking credit for someone else’s ideas, work, or words. In a university setting, it means submitting academic, scholarly, or literary work in which you either claim or imply the material to be your own, when that is not the case.\n\nThe Handbook also provides examples of plagiarism, and steps students can take to avoid it:\n[P]lagiarism could include:\n\nBuying a term paper, or copying another person’s paper, even if she or he gives you permission.\nCutting and pasting information from the internet into your own paper without properly identifying it as a quotation and properly attributing the source.\nUsing someone else’s concept and presenting it as if it is your own original creativity, without acknowledging the source of the idea.\n\nWhile some acts of plagiarism are obvious attempts to deceive, like buying a term paper, others result from sloppy scholarship or failure to follow proper format for crediting sources. For example:\n\nIf you copy directly from another source and acknowledge it in your bibliography or list of works cited, yet fail to put it in quotation marks, this is plagiarism. The reason is that, although you have indicated that the idea is someone else’s, the lack of quotation marks implies that the words are your own.\nParaphrasing is summarizing a source so that you have rewritten the material in your own words but maintained the original author’s ideas. When you paraphrase, you do not need to put the words in quotation marks, but you do need to properly attribute the original source. Paraphrasing does not mean simply changing one or two words, or leaving out a sentence, while the rest remains the same. Even if you identify the original author, but have used faulty paraphrasing that retains too much of the original, the result is inadvertent plagiarism.\nIf you use another researcher’s specific methodology, you should acknowledge doing so. While some research protocols are widespread and general enough to need no citation, if the protocol, analysis, or technique can be attributed to a specific publication it should be cited.\nWorks of visual art and design, and images of the work, cannot be misrepresented as original work by another. Such images cannot be used in part or whole without permission of the artist.\n\nAlso note that using papers previously written for another assignment in this, or in any other class, without the express permission of the professor is grounds for failing an assignment. Using your own material in this way, and not citing it, is also technically plagiarism and can be treated as such. If you have concerns regarding any of these issues please do not hesitate to contact me."

    "text": "Comparing two groups\nComparing group behaviors can be complicated because in addition to differences between the groups, there is also variation in how the individual members of those groups tend to behave. Let’s imagine that we want to compare bipartisanship in US foreign policy. There are different metrics we could use, but we’ll settle for Congressional voting patterns. We might want to know if Democrats are more or less bipartisan than Republicans. We could imagine that we’re going to sample votes taken by members of Congress where each member of Congress votes on a series of votes during each year—let’s say 100 votes—and we could code those votes as bipartisan (1) or not (0). Rather than collecting data on every vote we decide to just sample from one year. At the end we might end up with a distribution of bipartisan votes that looks like this:\n\n\nSaving 7 x 5 in image\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure shows the distribution of the percentage of the 100 votes each legislator makes that are bipartisan—A value of 60 means that 60 of the 100 votes, or 60% of the 100 votes, a given legislator makes are bipartisan and 40% are not. We’ll focus on the raw count of votes rather than percent for now, but the 100 vote total simplifies this to make these voting totals more intuitive for present purposes. Dealing with proportional measures can get more complicated, but we’ll set some of that aside for now."

    "section": "Statistical methods for determining differences between groups",
    "text": "Statistical methods for determining differences between groups\nSo are Republicans and Democrats different? Are they meaningfully different? How can we tell? The idea here is that when we’re dealing with data of the kind shown in the above example, we want to understand if the differences between two groups are 1) systematic or are they the result of chance, and 2) how big or substantively meaningful are the differences we observe? Making these sorts of judgements by looking at this figure alone is difficult.\nFor example, a simple comparison of the mean values of the two parties suggests that Democrats have a higher rate of bipartisanship than do Republicans. But the data shown above are also very noisy, they represent just a sample from a broader set of votes, and there’s quite a bit of overlap between members of each group, so we can’t be sure from casual observation that the differences we think we observe are accurate representations of broader differences between the two groups. This is where we turn to some basic statistical methods that can help us to estimate if and how two or more groups might be different from one another with respect to some outcome of interest.\n\nDifference of Means Tests\nThe sorts of statistical methods used by researchers vary quite a bit depending on the question at hand, but for this basic example we can start with something really simple called a difference of means test, or a t test. This test allows us to look at the values of two continuous variables and compare their mean values. Another way to think of this is to compare the values of a given variable across two groups. In our example we’re interested in comparing the mean number of bipartisan votes for Republican and Democratic legislators. So political party represents our grouping variable and the outcome of interest is the count of the number of bipartisan votes.\n\n\n\n\nDifference of means test of bipartisan voting\n\n\nParameter1\nParameter2\nMean_1\nMean_2\nDiff\nCI\nCI_low\nCI_high\nt\ndf_error\np\nMethod\nAlternative\n\n\n\n\nRepublican\nDemocrat\n44.88\n50.51\n-5.63\n0.95\n-6.6\n-4.67\n-11.47\n406.57\n0\nWelch Two Sample t-test\ntwo.sided\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output in @ref(tab:t-test-example) resembles the output for a regression model that we’ll discuss below, but is much simpler. It tells us the names of the two groups, the mean score for each of the two groups, the difference between those mean scores, and the confidence interval, confidence interval limit values, and the test statistic or t value. There is also more information contained in the table about the type of t test and the direction of the test. Sometimes you might want to look at whether or not a group has a score that is higher or lower than another group, meaning that you have some specific direction in mind. In our case we’re content to just look at a non-directional test to see if the means of the two groups are different without hypothesizing the direction of that difference in advance. For now our basic hypothesis is that the groups are different, and our null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the two groups.\nSo is there a difference in the bipartisan voting behavior of the two parties? The t test shows that the Republican score is indeed lower than the Democratic score, and that this difference is statistically significant at the 0.95 level. The Democratic score is 5.63 higher than the Republican score as can be seen in the “Diff” column, and the test yields a test statistic of -11.17. This translates to a very low p value, which indicates the probability of seeing a test statistic greater than or equal to the observed test statistic of the null hypothesis were true. This is a lot, I know, but the important point is that researchers generally want low p values.\nSo this result is statistically significant, but is it substantively significant? That’s up to the researcher and requires some knowledge of the specific topic and/or broader domain expertise. In this example we see that, on average, Republican legislators case a bipartisan vote about 45% of the time and Democratic legislators case a bipartisan vote about 50% of the time. This this case we’re looking at a difference of approximately 5 percentage points. Again, whether or not this is substantively meaningful requires a lot of additional context, and my purpose here is less to tell you the answer to that specific question for this hypothetical and more to help you to learn to be thoughtful and cautious when consuming statistical analyses.\n\n\nRegression Models\nThe t test represents a very simple approach to analyzing the differences between two groups. While this can be useful, sometimes our data and the relationships between variables of interest are too complicated for a simple t test. In some cases we might want to know how groups compare when taking into account a number of other factors. Regression models are a broad class of statistical tools that allow us to model more complex relationships among various predictor and outcome variables. A fuller treatment of regression models is more than I want to get into for the purposes of this class, but there are a couple of points I want to highlight.\n\n\n\nLinear Regression Predicting Bipartisan Votes\n\n\n\nModel 1\n\n\n\n\nRepublicans\n−5.634***\n\n\n\n(0.487)\n\n\nIntercept\n50.509***\n\n\n\n(0.331)\n\n\nNum.Obs.\n434\n\n\nR2\n0.236\n\n\nR2 Adj.\n0.234\n\n\nAIC\n2643.2\n\n\nBIC\n2655.4\n\n\nLog.Lik.\n−1318.600\n\n\nF\n133.598\n\n\nRMSE\n5.05\n\n\n\n + p &lt; 0.1, * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, Table @ref(tab:linear-regression-example) shows the results of a regression model where we model bipartisan votes as a function of party identification. There’s a lot here but we’re only going to focus on a couple of points.\nFirst, the higlighted row with the red text is really what we’re interested in when comparing the two parties as we discuss above. The left column shows us the name of the variable—in this case it’s the group we’re interested in, which is the political party of the observed legislator. The right column shows us the correlation coefficient. Basically this tells us how big the difference is between the Democratic legislators (the reference group here) and the Republican legislators. Note that the number listed here, -5.634, is the same as the number listed in the t test above!\nThe asterisks next to the coefficient represent the level of statistical significance associated with that coefficient. This is often used as a marker of importance, but for reasons we’ve discussed briefly above, this isn’t always a great basis on which to judge the substantive significance of a result.\nWhere do these stars come from? Well, the number in the parentheses below the coefficient is the standard error of the coefficient. Basically, you divide the coefficient value by the standard error (i.e. \\(-5.64/0.48\\)) and (according to some arbitrarily defined conventions) a coefficient earns another asterisk every time that resulting ratio crosses a particular threshold. Don’t worry about that too much right now.\nThe Intercept represents the expected value of the outcome when the other predictor variables are set to 0. In this case the intercept represented the mean value of the bipartisan voting indicator (our outcome) when the Republican variable is set to 0. In other words, this is the mean score for the Democrats! See above in the t test table to check it out (there’s some minor rounding)!\nThere are other details here that can be useful, like the “N” or the number of observations. This tells you how many times we’re observing the phenomenon of interest. We often want more information, but a larger N doesn’t solve all our problems if there are other serious flaws with our measurement strategy or research design.\nAt the bottom of the table you can often find a listing of the significance thresholds. Each symbol corresponds to a particular p value. Remember that we derive these p values from the coefficient and the standard error. You can have very very small p values for coefficients with very very small substantive effects, so this is not equivalent to the importance of a coefficient. I can’t say that enough!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In class the other day I made note of the fact that we sometimes use terms in political science that might have a different meaning as compared to how those same terms are used when we talk about politics in a less technical setting.\n\nBias\nA good example of this is the concept of bias. In more casual settings we typically hear the term bias used as a way of discrediting a source of information. Usually this is because that source is viewed as selectively presenting information, or framing it in such a way, so as to advance a particular political agenda.\nIn political science when we use the term bias we are often referring to characteristics of a sample or measurement. More specifically, bias is usually used to refer to the gap between the information we have and the “true” underlying value that we’re interested in.\nFor example, if we’re interested in estimating the average height of a population we might begin by taking a sample of people from that population. Let’s say that we have a population of 1,000 people—then we might sample 100 people from that population and take their average height. We could then use this to estimate the average height of the entire population. Let’s take a look:\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\nWarning in geom_vline(xintercept = mean(sample$sample), linetype = \"dashed\", :\nIgnoring unknown parameters: `label`\n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulated height values in inches.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows 1000 simulated height values (in inches). We have a mean of 69 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches. We’ll set aside whether this is accurate or not for the time being, but it’s close enough for present purposes. The purple values show 20 sample values taken from the population. We’ll also assume for present purposes that our selection process only targets a particularly young portion of the population who are between 12 and 25 years of age, and so many of the people we’ve selected are not fully grown yet. Finally, the dashed line shows the mean height of the sample group and the solid line is the mean value of the population.\nA couple of details emerge. First, the size of the sample is necessarily smaller than the population. This is obvious as we only chose 20 out of 1000 people. That’s why we call it a sample! Second, and most importantly for present purposes, you can see that there is a gap between the two mean values—this is the bias in our estimate!\nBias like this can result from a variety of sources. Using height as an example, we might find bias in our sample if the people we sample are all professional basketball players (more likely to be taller), or are all under the age of 25 (younger people are more likely to be shorter). That’s what we did in this example. We could easily do the same thing with another measure like age. If we’re interested in estimating the average age of people in a county or state, and if we only sampled individuals by drawing on people within primary and secondary schools, then our estimate of age would be biased. In this case a biased sample would produce a biased estimate.\nNo matter what measure you choose to focus on, you have to be cognizant of the potential sources of bias—the things that can lead you to estimate a quantity of interest that is different from the actual underlying value in which you are interested. To be clear, there will almost always be a difference—the question is how close are we to the actual value we’re interested in. Often times these problems can be lessened or even remedied by ensuring that our sample matches the characteristics of the population and/or by collecting more data (i.e. by collecting a larger sample).\nIn this first example you can see that most of our sampled observations are close to the mean, but this is because this is still where most of the probability mass of the distribution is located. Next, let’s see what happens if we broaden our sampling procedure to ensure we’re sampling from the entire population:\n\n\nWarning in geom_vline(xintercept = mean(sample$sample), linetype = \"dashed\", :\nIgnoring unknown parameters: `label`\n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulated height values in inches.\n\n\n\n\nThere’s still some bias, but the line moves closer to the population mean because we’ve altered our sampling procedure to ensure we’re not just targeting younger people in the population. Now we’re sampling from the entire population. But now our sample mean is above the population mean instead of below. This is a result of the small sample we’ve chosen. Smaller samples are more likely to yield noise. Now let’s see what happens when we keep everything the same but simply increase the size of the sample 10 times:\n\n\nWarning in geom_vline(xintercept = mean(sample$sample), linetype = \"dashed\", :\nIgnoring unknown parameters: `label`\n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulated height values and a sample of 200 individuals\n\n\n\n\nThe lines moved closer together, just by increasing the size of the sample! Accordingly, we have reduced the bias of our estimate. Importantly, though, there is still going to be some amount of bias. It is often not something we can ever completely eliminate, but we can try to reduce it.\n\n\nAccuracy and Validity\nTwo other terms that we’ll use that have more technical meaning are accuracy and validity. These are maybe less at odds with popular useage than bias, but it’s good to review them just to make sure we’re on the same page.\nWhen we’re collecting data we’re often trying to measure some phenomenon of interest. This is true whether we’re talking about qualitative data collection or quantitative data collection. Validity refers to how close a measure is to the concept that we’re interested in measuring. Reliability refers to how consistent our attempts to measure that concept or phenomenon are.\nFigure 3 captures this concept. If we imagine a dart board or a target, validity refers to how close to the bulls eye we get when we try to measure the thing of interest. Similarly, reliability refers to our target grouping. If we’re hitting the bulls eye, or close to it, every time we throw a dart then we’d say that our measurement has a high degree of validity and reliability. If our darts tend to center around the bulls eye but are evenly scattered around the board then then we’d say our measurement instrument is valid, but not very reliable. If our attempts to measure the thing of interest aren’t near the bulls eye and are scattered around, then we’d say our measurement instrument are neither valid nor reliable. ultimately, validity and reliability can both be high, low, or some combination of the two.\n\n\nWarning: Using the `size` aesthetic in this geom was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` in the `default_aes` field and elsewhere instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy and validity\n\n\n\n\nThese concepts matter in real life in a wide range of situations. If we want to know how the public feels about a particular policy then the way we phrase a question on a survey instrument can have a huge impact on the quality of the responses with respect to the views we’re trying to tap into. If we have a medical test designed to test for the presence of a particular disease then we want to make sure that the test going to detect that disease with a high rate of success, while also minimizing the chances that it detects other diseases that we’re not interested in."

    "text": "All work turned in as a part of this class must be original.\nKansas State University has an Honor & Integrity System based on personal integrity which is presumed to be sufficient assurance in academic matters one’s work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full and part time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning.\nA component vital to the Honor & Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: “On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.”\nThe default in this class is that ALL work will be accomplished individually, UNLESS my permission is given in advance of an assignment/quiz/exam/take-home exam/final. If you are in doubt, please ask.\nA grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.\nFor more information, visit the Honor & Integrity System home web page. All work is expected to adhere to the standards outlined by the Kansas State University Handbook. All written work is subject to online plagiarism checks and will be required for all reaction papers as well as the final paper. Any cases of plagiarism will receive an automatic failure for the assignment, possible failure in the course, and will be pursued further through the university for additional punishment.\nThe Kansas State University Handbook (2008, Appendix F) defines plagiarism as follows:\n\nPlagiarism is taking credit for someone else’s ideas, work, or words. In a university setting, it means submitting academic, scholarly, or literary work in which you either claim or imply the material to be your own, when that is not the case.\n\nThe Handbook also provides examples of plagiarism, and steps students can take to avoid it:\n[P]lagiarism could include:\n\nBuying a term paper, or copying another person’s paper, even if she or he gives you permission.\nCutting and pasting information from the internet into your own paper without properly identifying it as a quotation and properly attributing the source.\nUsing someone else’s concept and presenting it as if it is your own original creativity, without acknowledging the source of the idea.\n\nWhile some acts of plagiarism are obvious attempts to deceive, like buying a term paper, others result from sloppy scholarship or failure to follow proper format for crediting sources. For example:\n\nIf you copy directly from another source and acknowledge it in your bibliography or list of works cited, yet fail to put it in quotation marks, this is plagiarism. The reason is that, although you have indicated that the idea is someone else’s, the lack of quotation marks implies that the words are your own.\nParaphrasing is summarizing a source so that you have rewritten the material in your own words but maintained the original author’s ideas. When you paraphrase, you do not need to put the words in quotation marks, but you do need to properly attribute the original source. Paraphrasing does not mean simply changing one or two words, or leaving out a sentence, while the rest remains the same. Even if you identify the original author, but have used faulty paraphrasing that retains too much of the original, the result is inadvertent plagiarism.\nIf you use another researcher’s specific methodology, you should acknowledge doing so. While some research protocols are widespread and general enough to need no citation, if the protocol, analysis, or technique can be attributed to a specific publication it should be cited.\nWorks of visual art and design, and images of the work, cannot be misrepresented as original work by another. Such images cannot be used in part or whole without permission of the artist.\n\nAlso note that using papers previously written for another assignment in this, or in any other class, without the express permission of the professor is grounds for failing an assignment. Using your own material in this way, and not citing it, is also technically plagiarism and can be treated as such. If you have concerns regarding any of these issues please do not hesitate to contact me."

    "text": "All work turned in as a part of this class must be original.\nKansas State University has an Honor & Integrity System based on personal integrity which is presumed to be sufficient assurance in academic matters one’s work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full and part time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning.\nA component vital to the Honor & Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: “On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.”\nThe default in this class is that ALL work will be accomplished individually, UNLESS my permission is given in advance of an assignment/quiz/exam/take-home exam/final. If you are in doubt, please ask.\nA grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.\nFor more information, visit the Honor & Integrity System home web page. All work is expected to adhere to the standards outlined by the Kansas State University Handbook. All written work is subject to online plagiarism checks and will be required for all reaction papers as well as the final paper. Any cases of plagiarism will receive an automatic failure for the assignment, possible failure in the course, and will be pursued further through the university for additional punishment.\nThe Kansas State University Handbook (2008, Appendix F) defines plagiarism as follows:\n\nPlagiarism is taking credit for someone else’s ideas, work, or words. In a university setting, it means submitting academic, scholarly, or literary work in which you either claim or imply the material to be your own, when that is not the case.\n\nThe Handbook also provides examples of plagiarism, and steps students can take to avoid it:\n[P]lagiarism could include:\n\nBuying a term paper, or copying another person’s paper, even if she or he gives you permission.\nCutting and pasting information from the internet into your own paper without properly identifying it as a quotation and properly attributing the source.\nUsing someone else’s concept and presenting it as if it is your own original creativity, without acknowledging the source of the idea.\n\nWhile some acts of plagiarism are obvious attempts to deceive, like buying a term paper, others result from sloppy scholarship or failure to follow proper format for crediting sources. For example:\n\nIf you copy directly from another source and acknowledge it in your bibliography or list of works cited, yet fail to put it in quotation marks, this is plagiarism. The reason is that, although you have indicated that the idea is someone else’s, the lack of quotation marks implies that the words are your own.\nParaphrasing is summarizing a source so that you have rewritten the material in your own words but maintained the original author’s ideas. When you paraphrase, you do not need to put the words in quotation marks, but you do need to properly attribute the original source. Paraphrasing does not mean simply changing one or two words, or leaving out a sentence, while the rest remains the same. Even if you identify the original author, but have used faulty paraphrasing that retains too much of the original, the result is inadvertent plagiarism.\nIf you use another researcher’s specific methodology, you should acknowledge doing so. While some research protocols are widespread and general enough to need no citation, if the protocol, analysis, or technique can be attributed to a specific publication it should be cited.\nWorks of visual art and design, and images of the work, cannot be misrepresented as original work by another. Such images cannot be used in part or whole without permission of the artist.\n\nAlso note that using papers previously written for another assignment in this, or in any other class, without the express permission of the professor is grounds for failing an assignment. Using your own material in this way, and not citing it, is also technically plagiarism and can be treated as such. If you have concerns regarding any of these issues please do not hesitate to contact me."
